** WIP **

Solving the code examples from [Harry J.W. Percivals 'Test-Driven Development with Python'](https://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/pages/book.html) using:

- Python 3.7
- Django 2.2
- Selenium 3.141.0

# Prerequisites

## Using and Pipenv

Harry described using the classic Python venv within his book. I've used Pipenv,
which is the reason while this repository contains `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock`.

You should be able the reproduce everything using Harrys Python venv approach.
Yet, if you want to use Pipevn, here is how to:

### TODO


## Install Firefox

## Install Geckodriver

1. Download https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases
2. Unpack to `/usr/local/bin`
